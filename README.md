# AnyBaseConverter

This program Converts a number of any base to any another base as you wish.

Instructions:
Its not that complicated.


The program asks the number and its base.
It also asks the Base to which you want to convert it to.


For numbers having bases greater than 10 :

The program will ask to enter the digits one by one, and because the base is greater than 10, numbers having 2 
or more digits will be considered as a single digit.

NOTE : If a number is being converted to base greater than 10, then the process will be something like this :
        
        Enter the Base from which you want to Convert: 10      
        Enter the Base to which you want to Convert:   20  
        Enter the Base 10 Number :  3129
        3129 in Base 20 is :  07 16 9
    
In this case, the numbers which are separated by spaces on both sides, must be considered as a single digit.
So the resultant number is  : 7G9
